“Messi needs to block out the negativity from everyone,” Kleberson told us-bookies.com. “People expect him to play the same way playing for Argentina as he does when he plays for Barcelona.

“He needs to be play with freedom, his fellow team-mates need to work hard to win the ball back and find Messi so he can have the ball at his feet.” 

Himself a former team-mate of ex-Barcelona man Ronaldinho, Kleberson can understand how to bring out the best from a talented compatriot for the overall good of the side.

“I remember when I played with Ronaldinho,” he continued. “I said to him ‘do not worry about defending, that is my job. I will get you the ball and you do the rest’; I knew he had the ability and the creativity to win us the game.” 

Brazil are the favourites to win the Copa America on home soil, but Kleberson does not believe Tite’s current squad compares with the quality of the 2002 World Cup-winning team he was part of.

“They have some amazing players in this team now,” admitted Kleberson. “But, if you saw some of the players in 2002, you would have thought ‘wow’. 

“When I was playing in 2002 and looked at the substitutes’ bench, I saw some brilliant young players.

“They have good players now but if you are comparing the squad then and now, the team in 2002 was outstanding. I do not think any players could get into that team.”
